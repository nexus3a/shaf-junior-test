Don't use any libraries, only vanilla JS
Create 2 scripts - touratte.js (Event Dispatcher) and renderer.js
Use the following authors:

const authorsList = [
    {
        _id: 1
        name: 'Todd',
    },
    {
        _id: 3
        name: 'Rob',
    },
    {
        _id: 3
        name: 'Sevil',
    },
];

touratte.js should

Create CustomEvent with name shout and detail with the random author (from authorsList) and randomly generated text.
The script will dispatch the event on a random interval (1-5 seconds)

renderer.js should

Listen to dispatched Event shout.
Add to the page caught shout with author name and text.
Add to the page the list of authors with the count of shouts.
